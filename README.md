# Calculator Project

## Description
Developing a calculator after learning the basics of **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript** is one of the best ways to understand core web development concepts and implement them to create something useful. This project is a fully functional calculator that supports both simple and complex calculations.

This calculator includes basic arithmetic operations such as:
- Addition (`+`)
- Subtraction (`-`)
- Multiplication (`*`)
- Division (`/`)
- Modulo (`%`)
- Square of a number
- **AC (All Clear)** button to reset the input
- **Equal (`=`)** key to perform operations

The calculator works with both **decimal** and **whole numbers**.

## Features
âœ… User-friendly UI with responsive design (using **CSS Flexbox/Grid** and **Bootstrap**)
âœ… Supports **event listeners, loops, conditional statements (if/else), innerText/innerHTML**
âœ… Clean and readable code with proper **comments** for better understanding
âœ… **No external libraries** used; everything is built using **vanilla JavaScript**
âœ… Fully deployed and accessible via **Netlify**
